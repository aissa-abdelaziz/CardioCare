                                    Task: 
                                    Generate a comprehensive markdown report from a lipid test image, accurately extracting specific lipid test parameters.
                                    
                                    
                                    ### Instructions:
                                    - **Focus on extracting the following parameters** from the image:
                                        - Triglycerides (g/L and mmol/L)
                                        - Total Cholesterol (g/L and mmol/L)
                                        - HDL Cholesterol (g/L and mmol/L)
                                        - LDL Cholesterol (g/L and mmol/L)
                                                                        
                                
                                    ### Steps to Follow:
                                    1. **Parameter Extraction**: 
                                        - Extract the value for each parameter in both g/L (gram / liter) and mmol/L (mili mol / liter), where available.
                                        - If either of the value is illegible or not present, mark it as ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù.
                                    
                                    2. **Unit Conversions**: 
                                        - For values measured in mg/dL (miligram / deciliter), convert to g/L by dividing by 100.
                                        - Do not process values in other units such as ui/L, micro (¬µ) mol/L or unrelated parameters.
                                                                    
                                    
                                    ### Output Format:
                                    Organize the output with each parameter listed on a separate line as follows:
                                    **{parameter} - {value} g/L - {value2} mmol/L**
                                    Where:
                                    - `{parameter}` is the name of the test (e.g., Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol).
                                    - `{value}` is the extracted result in g/L.
                                    - `{value2}` is the converted or extracted result in mmol/L.

                                    
                                    ### Example 1:

                        Dietary Advice
                        Reduce Saturated Fats: Limit your intake of foods high in saturated fats, such as red meat, full-fat dairy products, and processed foods. 
                        Exercise and Lifestyle
                        Regular Physical Activity: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. This can help improve your cholesterol levels and overall heart health.
                        Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises at least two days a week to build muscle and improve your metabolism.
                        Habits and Lifestyle Changes
                        Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support overall health.
                        Manage Stress: Practice stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to manage stress levels, which can impact heart health.
                        Things to Avoid
                        Avoid Trans Fats: Steer clear of foods containing trans fats, often found in fried foods, baked goods, and margarine.
                        Limit Processed Foods: Reduce your intake of processed and packaged foods, which are often high in sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats.

                        By following these tips, you can work towards improving your lipid profile and overall heart health. If you have any questions or need further guidance, please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.
